## Arithmetic calculator
Write a python program that accepts two integers from the user and performs some operations with those integers.

## Instructions
The program should greet the user with a welcome message and explain what it does, ask the user to enter an integer, and ask the user to enter another integer.

It should show a list of operations for the user to choose from, ask the user which operation they want to perform, and perform the selected operation on the inputs.

After performing the operation, the program should ask the user if they want to perform another operation. If the user says yes, the program should repeat itself by asking the user to enter an input again, if the user says no, end the program, and if the user inputs anything other than yes or no, a message should be printed and the prompt asking if the user wants to perform any other operation should be repeated until the user inputs yes or no. Pleas note that the user's yes or no should perform the required operation irrespective of it's lettercase.

You should handle errors in your code by printing an error message if the user inputs a non-integer, non-listed operation number.

The program should be able to perform sum, difference, product, and division operations on the integers.

## Note
You are to write your code in the main.py.
The finalcode.py contains the solution to the task.
This task is designed to test your knowledge on variables, python operators, if-else statements, try and except, and loops.
